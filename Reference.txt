Routing
====
  As react is a library, let's use the third party tool react-router-dom to setup routing.

  Step 1:
  ---
    npm i react-router-dom

  Step 2: 
  ---
    Identify the Menus and the URLs 
    
    Home              /
    Netflix           /netflix
    Employee Manager  /employees
    Todos             /todos 
    About Us          /about-us 

    Let's add the menus in MenuList.

  Step 3: 
  ---
    Let's create the necessary components for the Menus 

    Home                    Home Component 
    Netflix                 Netflix Component
    Employee Manager        Employees Components
    Todos                   Todos Component
    About Us                AboutUs Component

  Step 4
  ----
    To setup routing configuration, do the following first.
    Load the app component under BrowserRouter in main.tsx 

  Step 5:
  ----
    Let's configure the routes in App.tsx.
    Check the app. Page is still reloading. Let's fix

  Step 6: 
  ---
    in MenuList replace <a href=""  with <Link to=""

Rules of Hooks 
---
  * use hooks only in functional components
  * use hooks only in top level
  * do not use hooks in nested level
  * do not use hooks in conditional rendering, loops, nested functions
  * do not use hooks after if/else, for loops, after functions
